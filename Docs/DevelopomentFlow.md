# Development flow

If you want to help in the Contador development please do it right with the following steps:
1. Assign issue to you.
2. Create separate branch for this issue. For branch naming please follow these [rules.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops)
3. Prepare code that meets coding style rules.
4. Push code to the repo and create PR.
5. After all actions are success and review by the author or the collaborators are done the code will be merged to the `nibel`.

**Thank you in advance for your commitment.**
