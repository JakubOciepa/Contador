# Development flow

If you want to help in the Contador development please do it right with the following steps:
1. Assign issue to you.
2. Create separate branch for this issue. For branch naming please follow these [rules.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops)
3. Prepare code that meets coding style rules.
4. Push code to the repo and create PR.
5. After all actions are success and review by the author or the collaborators are done the code will be merged to the `nibel`.

### Commit messages:

Commit messages should contain last word of the project name in the square brackets. 
e.g:
    
    "[Mobile] Prepare custom renderer of the label in the android project."
    "[MySQL] Add new column to the expense table."

For commits that are not project specific as scripts to build whole project please skip the project name.

**Thank you in advance for your commitment.**
